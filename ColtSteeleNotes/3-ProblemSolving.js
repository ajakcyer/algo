/*
            OBJECTIVES
    - Define what an algorithm is
    - Create a plan to solve algorithms
    - Compare and contrast problem solving patterns
*/


/*
            What is an Algorithm?
    - A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task
    
    Almost EVERYTHING you do in programming involves algorithms.
    It's the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer
*/


/*
            How to get better at solving problems?
    
    1. DEVISE a plan for solving problems
    2. MASTER common problem solving patterns (a lot of problems can be broken into certain categories, know the general recipe)

/*
            Problem Solving Strategies! (COMES WITH VIDEOS)

    - Understand the Problem
    - Explore Concrete Examples
    - Break it down
    - Solve / Simplify
    - Look back and refactor
