/* 
            OBJECTIVES
    
    - Understand how objects and arrays work through the lens of Big O (is there a fast way? is there a slow way?)
    - Explain why adding element to the beginning of an array is costly (is there a better way?)
    - Compare and contrast the runtime for arrays and objects, as well as built-in methods
