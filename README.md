# Data Structures & Algorithm Notes

## Big O Notation

- expresses runtime by *how quickly it grows relative to the input as the input get large*

    - we express *how quickly the runtime grows* rather than the exact runtime in seconds
    - we use the size of the input **"n"** 
        - "The runtime grows on the order of the size of the input **O(n)**" or "on the order of the square of the size of the input **O(n)**"
